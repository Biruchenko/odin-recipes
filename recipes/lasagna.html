				<span>Step 1</span>
				<span>
					Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbled; drain excess grease. Stir in olives and water; season with minced garlic, oregano, onion flakes, garlic powder, pepper, sage, and basil. Simmer, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat.

			<li>
				<span>Step 3</span>
				<span>
					Spoon a layer of meat and sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over noodles; sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce; repeat layering, ending with meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.

			</li>
			<li>
				<span>Step 4</span>
				<span>
					Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes. Lasagna is cooked when it's easily pierced with a knife. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella cheese over lasagna and bake until melted, about 10 minutes more.
